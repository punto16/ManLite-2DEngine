**Final Project for Videogames Design and Development Degree**  
A lightweight 2D game engine designed for simplicity and performance in modern game development.

## 📖 Overview
ManLite is a modular 2D game engine developed as the capstone project for my Videogames Design and Development degree. Built with C++20 and OpenGL 3.3, it focuses on providing essential game development components while maintaining a clean, easy-to-extend architecture.
